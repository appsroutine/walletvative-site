# Privacy Policy for Walletvative

_Last updated: October 2025_

Walletvative (‚Äúthe App‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù, or ‚Äúour‚Äù) is a personal finance application designed to help users track spending, set goals, and improve financial awareness.  
We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your data. This policy explains how Walletvative handles user information.

---

## 1. Data Collection and Storage
Walletvative does **not collect, store, or process** any personal, financial, or identifiable information on external servers.  
All data (such as expenses, categories, and goals) is securely stored **locally on your device** using Apple‚Äôs **SwiftData** framework.

If you enable optional features:
- **iCloud Sync:** Your data is stored securely in your own iCloud account.  
  The developer does **not** have access to this information.
- **Notifications:** The app may request permission to send reminders or alerts that you configure manually.  
  Notification content is generated locally and not shared with any third party.

---

## 2. Advertising and Third-Party Services
The free version of Walletvative uses **Google AdMob** to display ads.  
AdMob may collect limited device identifiers to deliver relevant ads in compliance with **GDPR**, **CCPA**, and **Apple‚Äôs App Tracking Transparency (ATT)** framework.

We do **not** control the content of advertisements or any external links that may appear.  
By interacting with an ad, you may be redirected to third-party services outside the App.  
Walletvative and its developer are **not responsible** for any content, actions, or outcomes resulting from those external links.

**All ad targeting and personalization settings are fully managed by Google AdMob and the user‚Äôs consent choices.**  
**The developer does not directly access, process, or store any data used for ad personalization.**  
**In the event of an error, malfunction, or third-party misconfiguration leading to unintended ad personalization, the developer shall not be held legally liable.**

---

## 3. In-App Purchases
Walletvative offers optional in-app subscriptions processed exclusively through the **Apple App Store**.  
All payment and billing data are handled by Apple.  
We do **not** have access to your payment information or Apple ID credentials.

---

## 4. Financial Disclaimer
Walletvative is an **informational tool only.**  
It does **not provide financial, investment, or tax advice.**  
All insights, analytics, or recommendations displayed in the App are generated algorithmically for **educational and awareness purposes** only.

Users are fully responsible for their own financial decisions.  
The developer shall **not be held liable** for any loss, damage, or consequence resulting from the use or interpretation of information presented within the App.

---

## 5. Legal Compliance
Walletvative complies with:
- **GDPR (EU)**
- **CCPA (California)**
- **KVKK (Turkey)**

Because we do not collect or process any personal user data externally, Walletvative qualifies as a **‚Äúlocal data-only‚Äù** app under these regulations.

**All advertising, consent, and data processing are performed exclusively by Google AdMob in accordance with its own privacy policies and regulatory frameworks.**  
**The developer of Walletvative does not act as a data controller or processor for any advertising data and cannot be held responsible for AdMob‚Äôs independent data handling practices.**

---

## 6. Data Security
All user data remains within your device or iCloud account.  
We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to any third parties.  
If you uninstall the App, all locally stored data is permanently deleted.

---

## 7. Children‚Äôs Privacy
Walletvative is intended for users aged **16 and above**.  
We do not knowingly collect data from children.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy
This policy may be updated periodically to reflect improvements or new legal requirements.  
Any changes will be published on this page with an updated ‚ÄúLast Updated‚Äù date.

---

## 9. Contact
If you have questions or requests regarding privacy, data, or app use, please contact:  
üìß **appsroutine@gmail.com**

---

## 10. Third-Party SDK Behavior Disclaimer
Walletvative integrates Google AdMob solely to serve ads.  
While the App ensures that all relevant user consents are collected through the official Google UMP SDK,  
**the developer cannot technically control or audit how Google processes such data on its own servers.**

Therefore, by using the App, you acknowledge that any data collected by Google AdMob is governed by Google‚Äôs own privacy policy.  
Walletvative‚Äôs developer is **not responsible for Google‚Äôs independent data collection, usage, or ad-serving logic.**

**Limitation of Liability:**  
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Walletvative and its developer shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of the App or third-party advertising services integrated within it.

**Jurisdiction:**  
This Privacy Policy shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Turkey and applicable international data protection frameworks.
